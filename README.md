# VictoriaHousing-DataIntegration-DataShaping

(Go to https://github.com/DanielTranDS/VictoriaHousing-DataIntegration-DataReshaping/blob/main/DataIntegrationReshaping_Codes.ipynb for implementation)

Perform data integration and Data Shaping for 7 different datasets, in various formats (XML, json, pdf, ...), using Python

In this project, I will integrate numerous input datasets, all of which come in very different formats (html, json, xml, pdf, xlsx, txt, shapefiles), with the goal of creating 1 unified dataset. Each of these dataset is about an aspect of housing information in Victoria, Australia. In order to achieve this unified dataset, I will create new data schema that follow some business rules required, as well as find and fix possible problems in the data.

After that, I will study the effects of different normalization/transformation methods on given attributes and their effects when it comes to building a linear model.

Details on the data schema of the final unified dataset, as well as some business rules, are included in the Jupter notebook file.
